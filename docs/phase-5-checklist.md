# Phase 5 Checklist: Testing & Documentation

This checklist is for Phase 5 of the Plastic Instruments Video Grid Website project. Complete each item before moving to the next phase. Negative prompts (what NOT to do), a unit and integration testing phase, and explicit success criteria are included.

---

## ✅ Unit & Integration Testing
- [x] Review and run all unit tests for Python scripts (data fetching, parsing, database writing).
- [x] Review and run all unit tests for PHP functions (database access, rendering, sanitization).
- [x] Run integration tests for:
    - [x] End-to-end data flow: Python script populates database, PHP pages read and display data.
    - [x] Home page loads and displays video grid with real data.
    - [x] Video detail page loads and displays correct video, description, and published time.
    - [x] Navigation links (Home, Archive, Contact, Back) work as expected.
    - [x] Simulate empty, missing, or corrupted database and verify graceful error handling.
    - [x] Simulate API/network failures and verify fallback/error handling in the Python script.
- [x] Test responsiveness and layout on multiple devices and browsers.
- [x] Test accessibility (color contrast, font sizes, alt text, keyboard navigation).
- [x] DO NOT skip tests or ignore test failures.

## ✅ Documentation
- [x] Update `README.md` with:
    - [x] Any new usage instructions or requirements.
    - [x] Any changes to the stack, directory structure, or workflow.
    - [x] Troubleshooting and maintenance notes.
- [x] Update `docs/project-plan.md` with:
    - [x] Any changes or lessons learned during implementation.
    - [x] Final SQLite schema if it changed during development.
- [x] Ensure all checklists (phase 1-5) are complete and up-to-date.

- [x] All documentation is complete, clear, and up-to-date.
- [x] The site is fully functional, responsive, and accessible.
- [x] No sensitive data is exposed in the HTML, client-side code, or documentation.
