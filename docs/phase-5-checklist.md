# Phase 5 Checklist: Testing & Documentation

This checklist is for Phase 5 of the Plastic Instruments Video Grid Website project. Complete each item before moving to the next phase. Negative prompts (what NOT to do), a unit and integration testing phase, and explicit success criteria are included.

---

## ✅ Unit & Integration Testing
- [ ] Review and run all unit tests for Python scripts (data fetching, parsing, database writing).
- [ ] Review and run all unit tests for PHP functions (database access, rendering, sanitization).
- [ ] Run integration tests for:
    - [ ] End-to-end data flow: Python script populates database, PHP pages read and display data.
    - [ ] Home page loads and displays video grid with real data.
    - [ ] Video detail page loads and displays correct video, description, and published time.
    - [ ] Navigation links (Home, Archive, Contact, Back) work as expected.
    - [ ] Simulate empty, missing, or corrupted database and verify graceful error handling.
    - [ ] Simulate API/network failures and verify fallback/error handling in the Python script.
- [ ] Test responsiveness and layout on multiple devices and browsers.
- [ ] Test accessibility (color contrast, font sizes, alt text, keyboard navigation).
- [ ] DO NOT skip tests or ignore test failures.

## ✅ Documentation
- [ ] Update `README.md` with:
    - [ ] Any new usage instructions or requirements.
    - [ ] Any changes to the stack, directory structure, or workflow.
    - [ ] Troubleshooting and maintenance notes.
- [ ] Update `docs/project-plan.md` with:
    - [ ] Any changes or lessons learned during implementation.
    - [ ] Final SQLite schema if it changed during development.
- [ ] Ensure all checklists (phase 1-5) are complete and up-to-date.
- [ ] DO NOT leave out any major changes or implementation details from the documentation.

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] All unit and integration tests pass without errors.
- [ ] All documentation is complete, clear, and up-to-date.
- [ ] The site is fully functional, responsive, and accessible.
- [ ] No sensitive data is exposed in the HTML, client-side code, or documentation.
- [ ] The process is documented for future maintenance and onboarding.

## ✅ General
- [ ] Review all code, tests, and documentation for clarity and completeness.
- [ ] Ensure all negative prompts (what NOT to do) are considered and followed.
- [ ] DO NOT proceed to any future enhancements until every item on this checklist is complete and verified.
